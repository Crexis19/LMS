<!--Script for beginning of insurance-->
The beginning of Insurance:
Forms of insurance have existed since the Babylonianâ€™s (modern day Iraq). For example the Code of Hammurabi.
However as an industry it all began in the late 17th century.
Sailors and merchants used to sail with all their goods aboard ships. In the event that the ship sank all their valuables would be lost.
In 1687, Edward Lloyd opened a cafe on Tower Street, near the London docks. This was one of the hottest places for gossip. Particularly on ships and what they were carrying in and out.
Gamblers would even place bets on whether ships would arrive safely or not.
Lloyd began to assemble a network of reporters and informers and together they would publish newsletters full of all the latest port information. He also used the information from the gamblers to encourage people to invest in a group savings that insured if someone who invested lost their valuables the group would pay to recover the individuals losses.
This was the first form of organized insurance. The mutual trust of all the people involved developed into a center for marine insurance which then developed into other branches, such as the ones we have today.
