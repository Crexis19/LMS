                  <p>Dan and Elad began working on Zenner, their AI companion that would provide real-time travel advice and assistance such as early detection of flight cancellations or delays, assistance when making a tight connection and much more.</p>

                  <p>Zenner underwent a lot of changes, the focus shifted from being a chatbot to becoming a full scale travel insurer that would be there to protect a clients entire trip. After some major work was done, Zenner was rebranded as Faye, the company we know and love today!</p>
